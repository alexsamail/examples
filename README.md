# code examples 
This repository includes two projects.
1. Inversion - a small example of working with algorithms.

    *By permutation of numbers we call a sequence A of length N such that 1 ≤ Ai ≤ N, and all numbers in the sequence are different.
An inversion in the permutation A of size N is any pair of indices (i, j) such that i <j and Ai> Aj.
In this problem it is necessary to find the number of inversions in a given permutation.*
2. WpfApp1 - wpf-application practice in C#. A little link, collections, async etc.
